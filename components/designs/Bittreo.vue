			<p>I was initially brought into the project at a stage where a most of the work had already been developed without a designer and needed UX/UI refactoring. I have to remain fairly tight-lipped about the details of the platform but below are some screenshots of some select pages from the prototype showing the evolution of the product.</p>

		<div class="pt-6">
			<p>The project had several pages that needed graphic design elements to bring them to life. Using the established brand colours/identity, I created the pair of vector illustrations you see below.</p>
